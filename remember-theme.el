;;; remember-theme.el --- Remembers the last theme in use and re-loads for the next session.

;; Author: Jason Milkins <jasonm23@gmail.com>
;; Url: https://github.com/jasonm23/emacs-remember-theme
;; Version: 20130807.1251

;;; Commentary:

;; I keep my `.emacs` in source control, and use the same defaults on all
;; the machines I use. However, I like to have different themes on
;; different machines.
;; 
;; To help me do this automatically, I've created this little feature that
;; remembers the current theme when Emacs closes, and loads it again when
;; you start up (clearing any other loaded themes first.)

;;; Installation:

;; Install from the marmalade repo via elpa/pacakge.el, and everything
;; is set up for you automatically.
;; 
;; Install with: `M-x package-install remember-theme`

;; Changelog:
;; 20130807.1251
;; * Conditional execution (no theme, no save)
;; *
;; 20130718.230
