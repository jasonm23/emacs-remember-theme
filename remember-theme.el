;;; remember-theme.el --- Remembers the last theme in use and re-loads for the next session.

;; Author: Jason Milkins <jasonm23@gmail.com>
;; Url: https://github.com/jasonm23/emacs-remember-theme
;; Version: 20150308.1931

;;; Commentary:

;; I keep my `.emacs` in source control, and use the same defaults on all
;; the machines I use. However, I like to have different themes on
;; different machines.
;;
;; To help me do this automatically, I've created this little feature that
;; remembers the current theme when Emacs closes, and loads it again when
;; you start up (clearing any other loaded themes first.)
;;
;; If you have things you'd like to run after the theme has loaded,
;; use the hook provided, 'remember-theme-after-load-hook (see
;; add-hook if you haven't used hooks before.)

;;; Installation:

;; Install from the melpa via elpa/pacakge.el.
;; Then in .emacs / .emacs.d/init.el add:
;;
;; (remember-theme-load)
;; (add-hook 'kill-emacs-hook 'remember-theme-save)
;;
;; Install with: `M-x package-install remember-theme`
